# Instructions

# Congratulations, you've got a job at Python Pizza! Your first job is to build an automatic pizza order program.

# Based on a user's order, work out their final bill.

# Small pizza (S): $15

# Medium pizza (M): $20

# Large pizza (L): $25

# Add pepperoni for small pizza (Y or N): +$2

# Add pepperoni for medium or large pizza (Y or N): +$3

# Add extra cheese for any size pizza (Y or N): +$1
